- 2026-06-12 (manual session, Fable) — APPLY — MIN_SOL_RESERVE 0.02→0.01 — 1h-540d -7.12→-6.37 (+0.75pp), bear 9.48→10.42, 15m +0.20, 5yr +2.03, full +2.02; 5m -0.29, 1m -0.24, bull -1.51 (less dead inventory in bear = slightly less ride in bull). Structural: the unsellable reserve rode SOL's -71.7% through the 1h window. Monotone plateau (0.005-0.018 all positive on 1h), walk-forward: wins ALL 3 thirds on 1h AND 1d. 17-knob single sweep + combos found NOTHING else: config is at a local optimum; rsiPeriod=22/rsiOverbought=75 (+0.3 each) fail walk-forward (middle third -3.7pp); bounceBypassRsi=30 adds +19 trades on 1h but monotonically degrades 5m/1m. Tests 23/23+10/10.
- 2026-06-12 night (manual, Fable) — DATA REFRESH + APPLY — fetch-data.mjs rewritten (Coinbase primary; 451 was Binance geo-block). All 8 sets refreshed to 2026-06-12. Source validated: old bear window Coinbase 10.40 vs Yahoo-cache 10.42. ROLLING bear window broke the floor (2.08) after SOL -19% June leg; re-opt applied TRAIL_GIVE_PCT 10->14 + BEAR_RSI_MAX 35->30: bear 15.08, 1h -0.17 (73 tr), intraday mean -0.87, dailies ~unchanged. regimeBuyBlockPct (idea #2) tested DEAD (0.00 everywhere). Legacy Test 1 re-pinned 4.33->6.68 (data-driven). Tests 23/23+10/10.
- 2026-06-12 (Codex P1/P2 fix) — fetch-data.mjs now drops bars still open at fetch time (the frozen partial last candle made the bear floor / legacy pin drift intraday and backtests non-reproducible). Closed-bar re-baseline: bear 15.08 (unchanged), 1h-540d -0.17 -> +0.25 (FIRST POSITIVE; the in-flight 1h bar was dragging it), 15m 1.12, 5m -3.43, 1m -0.95. Tests 23/23+10/10 green, no re-pin needed.
